### Hello to all ðŸ‘‹

Hi I'm harun from Kenya.I'm currently pursuing a BSC in Civil and Construction Engineering at the University of Nairobi. I very much enjoy programming and all
that comes with it. From learning new frameworks to exploring those that already exist, I've persistently navigated the sea of development. I've always 
been particularly partial to the backend but kept an open mind. I mean, isn't that how full stack developers come into existence? I have quite the proficiency in Java
with languages such as C++, Python, JS coming second. I also have some experience in using Java data structures. I'm also interested in Dl, ML and AI. 
I hope to grow with time as I aim for the North Star in this unending sea of knowledge and ambitions.
